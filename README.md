# NLP-Filter

Experimenting an offensive speech filter, using synthetic data (generated from templates)

## GOAL
Trying out various simple classification algorithms
Working language: German.
NOTE 1: since all the data is generated from template, there are clear patterns, and none of the "noise" encountered in the wild.
NOTE 2: it might be interesting to extend this using (in order of complexity) a) word embeddings or b) language models, and then test it's performance on a publicly available dataset.
